# Virtual Connect Four

Virtual Connect Four allows users play classic Connect Four against one another or versus a bot.

## My Role
This was an app I had been playing with the concepts of for quite some time and I have built myself to put my javascript logic to the test

## Project Difficulties
This project really helped me understand more of the nitty gritty involved in React Hooks, I was also able to solve some fun problems involving nested arrays

## My Solution
I got deep into the React Hooks documentation, I built out a pretty elaborate custom hook and then decided that id didn't need to be a hook at all

## Notable Features
* Users can play classic connect four against one another or versus an artificially intelligent bot
* A function runs after every move to check for a winner to trigger a modal to pop up and alert players if a winner is found
* There is a scoreboard that keeps a running count of wins in either game mode and can be reset whenever
